I'm adding a new comment in the readme file to see the changes on cloud. 

steps that we followed are: 

1. we made changes to the project files
2. We saw the "git status" - this command provides the details of what's changes are made in the project. 
3. we review the changes and add the changes - "git add ." - this will add all the changes to the project
3. git status - check the status again
4. git commit the files - "git commit -m "add your commit message" " 
5. git status
6. once changes have been reviewed and verfied, add a commit message and push the code to the cloud. - "git push"

make sure give the username and the token that we generated. 

Review the changes are reflected on the cloud once pushed.
